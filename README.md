# NoteBot

NoteBot is a Forge Mod that can control the player to play noteblocks like an instrument automatically from converted midi files

NoteBot was originally created by zeairmouse AKA Victormeriqui


# How To

## Getting Started
1. Download or compile from source your desired version and add to your mods folder
2. Get a song and convert it to midi or get a midi file version of a song (best to not use songs with lyrics)
3. Create folder "NoteBot" in the mods folder, and create two more folders inside the "NoteBot" Folder, "Converted" & "ToConvert"
4. Export and put the midi file into the "ToConvert" folder in your mods/Notebot folder
5. Create a notebot area or download the world and add it to your worlds folder
6. Run minecraft with the mod
7. Go into the middle of the notbot area and press 'G' to open the GUI
8. Click "Center Player" and then click all of the "Map" buttons 
(If you know all the blocks are already tuned, like in the NoteBot world, click all the "Map" buttons and then click all the "Override" buttons and skip to step 13)
9. Click the top "Discover" button, exit the gui using "G" again and wait for all the blocks in that category to be clicked
10. Repeat for all the "Discover" buttons
11. Click the top "Tune" button, exit the gui using "G" again and wait for all the blocks in that category to be tuned
12. Repeat for all the "Tune" buttons
13. Click the midi converter tab and convert the desired midi file
14. Change to the editor tab, choose the midi file you just converted, and assign instruments to each track with the change instrument button then save
15. Change to the player tab and pick the song you just converted then press play

# Quick N' Dirty Ports (QNDP)
No support will be provided for these, think of them as a beta to what I may eventually release, they typically have very few bug fixes, have some broken features, and are generally not reccomended, at the very least i've confirmed they work somewhat and sometimes
